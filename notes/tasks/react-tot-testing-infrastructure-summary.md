# ReAct and ToT Testing Infrastructure - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of testing infrastructure for ReAct and Tree-of-Thoughts patterns, enabling integration tests to run without LLM calls.

**Branch**: `feature/react-tot-testing-infrastructure`

**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-15

## Objective

Enable the 6 skipped integration tests for ReAct and ToT patterns to run without requiring actual LLM API calls, similar to how Self-Consistency tests work with injectable `reasoning_fn`.

## Key Discovery

Upon researching the codebase, we discovered that **testing infrastructure already exists** in both ReAct and ToT implementations:

### ReAct (`lib/jido/runner/react.ex`)
- **Line 118**: `:thought_fn` parameter - Custom thought generation function for testing
- **Lines 288-289**: Checks for `thought_fn` and uses it if provided
- **Lines 358-381**: `simulate_thought_output/1` for simulation

### Tree-of-Thoughts (`lib/jido/runner/tree_of_thoughts.ex`)
- **Line 101**: `:thought_fn` parameter - Custom thought generation for testing
- **Line 102**: `:evaluation_fn` parameter - Custom evaluation for testing

### ToT Support Modules
- **`ThoughtGenerator` (`lib/jido/runner/tree_of_thoughts/thought_generator.ex`)**:
  - Lines 127-129: Uses `thought_fn` if provided
  - Lines 337-398: Simulation helpers (`simulate_sampling_thoughts`, `simulate_proposal_thoughts`)

- **`ThoughtEvaluator` (`lib/jido/runner/tree_of_thoughts/thought_evaluator.ex`)**:
  - Lines 113-114: Uses `evaluation_fn` if provided
  - Lines 356-444: Simulation helpers (`simulate_value_evaluation`, `default_heuristic_score`)

## Solution

Instead of implementing new infrastructure, we updated the integration tests to **use the existing infrastructure** by providing injectable functions.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
**`test/integration/cot_patterns_integration_test.exs`**

### ReAct Integration Tests (3 tests)

#### Test 3.5.2.1: Thought-Action-Observation Loop
```elixir
thought_fn = fn state, _opts ->
  case state.step_number do
    0 -> "Thought: ...\nAction: search\nAction Input: ..."
    1 -> "Thought: ...\nAction: search\nAction Input: ..."
    _ -> "Thought: ...\nFinal Answer: Paris"
  end
end

{:ok, result} = ReAct.run(
  question: "What is the capital...",
  tools: tools,

  end
end
```

**What it tests**:

  beam_width = Keyword.get(opts, :beam_width, 3)

  Enum.map(1..beam_width, fn i ->
    "Approach #{i} at depth #{depth}"
  end)
end

evaluation_fn = fn opts ->
  thought = Keyword.fetch!(opts, :thought)
  # Parse depth from thought and score based on depth
  case depth do
    2 -> 0.9  # High score at target depth
    1 -> 0.7
    _ -> 0.5
  end
end

solution_check = fn node ->
  node.depth == 2 && (node.value || 0.0) > 0.8
end

{:ok, result} = TreeOfThoughts.run(
  problem: "Test BFS exploration",
  search_strategy: :bfs,
  beam_width: 3,
  max_depth: 3,
  budget: 50,

    "Path #{i} at level #{depth}"
  end)
end

evaluation_fn = fn opts ->
  thought = Keyword.fetch!(opts, :thought)
  cond do
    String.contains?(thought, "Path 2") && String.contains?(thought, "level 3") -> 0.95
    String.contains?(thought, "Path 2") -> 0.8
    true -> 0.6

    String.contains?(thought, "option 2") -> 0.7  # Medium quality
    String.contains?(thought, "option 3") -> 0.3  # Low quality (pruned)
  end
end
```

**What it tests**:
- Thought quality evaluation
- Best-first search prioritization
- High-quality solution paths
- Thought generation tracking

## Test Results

### Before Implementation
```
22 tests, 0 failures, 6 skipped
```
- ReAct tests: 3 skipped (marked with `@describetag :skip`)
- ToT tests: 3 skipped (marked with `@describetag :skip`)

### After Implementation
```
22 tests, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```
- ReAct tests: 3 passing ✅
- ToT tests: 3 passing ✅
- All Stage 3 integration tests now run without LLM calls

## Technical Details

### Injectable Functions Pattern

Both ReAct and ToT use a consistent pattern for test injection:

1. **Check for custom function**: `if thought_fn do`
2. **Use custom function**: `{:ok, thought_fn.(state, opts)}`
3. **Fall back to LLM**: `else generate_thought_with_llm(state)`

This allows tests to:
- Bypass LLM calls entirely
- Control exact reasoning behavior
- Test edge cases deterministically
- Run quickly without API latency

### ToT Injectable Functions

ToT has two injectable functions:

1. **`thought_fn`**: Generates thoughts/branches at each node
   - Receives: `opts` keyword list with `:depth`, `:beam_width`, `:parent_state`
   - Returns: List of thought strings

2. **`evaluation_fn`**: Evaluates thought quality
   - Receives: `opts` keyword list with `:thought`, `:problem`, `:state`
   - Returns: Float score from 0.0 to 1.0

### ReAct Injectable Function

ReAct has one injectable function:

1. **`thought_fn`**: Generates thought-action-observation
   - Receives: `state` map and `opts` keyword list
   - Returns: String in format:
     ```
     Thought: <reasoning>
     Action: <action_name>
     Action Input: <input>
     ```
     OR
     ```
     Thought: <reasoning>
     Final Answer: <answer>
     ```

## Comparison with Self-Consistency

| Pattern | Injectable Function | Parameters | Return Type |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Self-Consistency | `reasoning_fn` | index (integer) | String (reasoning text) |
| ReAct | `thought_fn` | state, opts | String (thought-action) |
| ToT | `thought_fn` | opts | List of strings |
| ToT | `evaluation_fn` | opts | Float (0.0-1.0) |

All three patterns now support test injection, enabling comprehensive integration testing without LLM dependencies.

## Benefits

### 1. No LLM Required for Tests
- Tests run completely offline
- No API keys needed
- No cost for running tests
- Fast execution (< 1 second total)

### 2. Deterministic Testing
- Predictable behavior
- Consistent results
- Easier debugging
- Better CI/CD integration

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- Test full reasoning loops
- Test edge cases (convergence, timeouts, budget)
- Test all search strategies (BFS, DFS, Best-First)
- Test evaluation and pruning logic

### 4. Documentation
- Tests serve as usage examples
- Show how to structure injectable functions
- Demonstrate pattern behaviors

## Files Modified

### Test File
- **`test/integration/cot_patterns_integration_test.exs`**
  - Removed `@describetag :skip` from ReAct and ToT test blocks
  - Replaced structure validation tests with full integration tests
  - Added injectable `thought_fn` for all ReAct tests
  - Added injectable `thought_fn` and `evaluation_fn` for all ToT tests

### No Production Code Changes
**Important**: No changes to production code were required. The testing infrastructure already existed in the codebase.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Research Before Building
Before implementing new testing infrastructure, we researched the existing code and discovered the infrastructure already existed. This saved significant development time.

### 2. Consistent Patterns Across Codebase
The pattern of injectable functions (`thought_fn`, `evaluation_fn`, `reasoning_fn`) is consistent across Self-Consistency, ReAct, and ToT, showing good architectural design.

### 3. Test Flexibility is Key
Allowing tests to inject custom behavior makes testing complex AI/LLM patterns feasible without external dependencies.

### 4. Documentation in Code
The simulation functions (`simulate_thought_output`, `simulate_value_evaluation`) serve dual purposes:
- Provide fallback behavior for testing
- Document expected formats and behavior

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Test Scenarios
Could add more test scenarios:
- Error handling and recovery
- Timeout scenarios
- Invalid input handling
- Edge cases (empty tools, max depth reached)

### 2. Performance Testing
Could add performance benchmarks:
- Tree size vs. time
- Search strategy efficiency
- Memory usage patterns

### 3. Integration with Real LLMs
Could add optional integration tests that use real LLMs (behind feature flag or environment variable) to validate that injectable functions accurately simulate LLM behavior.

## Conclusion

Successfully enabled all 6 previously-skipped integration tests for ReAct and ToT patterns by leveraging existing testing infrastructure. All 22 Stage 3 CoT integration tests now pass without requiring LLM calls, providing comprehensive test coverage for advanced reasoning patterns.

The implementation demonstrates that well-designed abstractions (injectable functions) enable testability without sacrificing production behavior, and that thorough codebase research can reveal existing solutions before building new infrastructure.
