## Router Implementation

### Core Router Function

```elixir
@impl Jido.Skill
@spec router(keyword()) :: [map()]
def router(opts \\ []) do
  custom_routes = Keyword.get(opts, :custom_routes, [])
  mode = Keyword.get(opts, :mode, nil)

  base_routes = [
    # agent.reasoning.* routes
    %{
      path: "agent.reasoning.generate",
      instruction: %{
        action: CoT.GenerateReasoning,
        description: "Generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning for a problem"
      }
    },
    %{
      path: "agent.reasoning.step",
      instruction: %{
        action: CoT.ReasoningStep,
        description: "Execute an action with thought logging"
      }
    },
    %{
      path: "agent.reasoning.validate",
      instruction: %{
        action: CoT.ValidateReasoning,
        description: "Validate execution results against reasoning expectations"
      }
    },
    %{
      path: "agent.reasoning.correct",
      instruction: %{
        action: CoT.SelfCorrect,
        description: "Analyze errors and propose corrections"
      }
    },
    # agent.cot.* aliases
    %{path: "agent.cot.generate", instruction: %{action: CoT.GenerateReasoning, ...}},
    %{path: "agent.cot.step", instruction: %{action: CoT.ReasoningStep, ...}},
    %{path: "agent.cot.validate", instruction: %{action: CoT.ValidateReasoning, ...}},
    %{path: "agent.cot.correct", instruction: %{action: CoT.SelfCorrect, ...}}
  ]

  # Merge custom routes
  routes = base_routes ++ custom_routes

  # Filter by mode if specified (future enhancement)
  if mode do
    filter_routes_by_mode(routes, mode)
  else
    routes
  end
end
```

### Signal Patterns

The router maps the following signal patterns:

**Primary Routes (`agent.reasoning.*`)**:
- `agent.reasoning.generate` → `CoT.GenerateReasoning`
- `agent.reasoning.step` → `CoT.ReasoningStep`
- `agent.reasoning.validate` → `CoT.ValidateReasoning`
- `agent.reasoning.correct` → `CoT.SelfCorrect`

**Alias Routes (`agent.cot.*`)**:
- `agent.cot.generate` → `CoT.GenerateReasoning`
- `agent.cot.step` → `CoT.ReasoningStep`
- `agent.cot.validate` → `CoT.ValidateReasoning`
- `agent.cot.correct` → `CoT.SelfCorrect`

### Route Structure

Each route is a map with:
- `:path` - Signal pattern to match (string)
- `:instruction` - Instruction map containing:
  - `:action` - Action module to execute
  - `:description` - Description of the route (optional)

### Custom Route Registration

```elixir
@spec register_custom_routes(Agent.t(), list(map())) ::
  {:ok, list(map())} | {:error, :not_mounted}
def register_custom_routes(agent, custom_routes) when is_list(custom_routes) do
  case mounted?(agent) do
    true ->
      all_routes = router(custom_routes: custom_routes)
      {:ok, all_routes}

    false ->
      {:error, :not_mounted}
  end
end
```

Allows extending the router with domain-specific or experimental reasoning actions without modifying the core skill.

### Parameterized Routing

```elixir
@spec get_routes(Agent.t()) :: {:ok, list(map())} | {:error, :not_mounted}
def get_routes(agent) do
  case get_cot_config(agent) do
    {:ok, config} ->
      # Use configuration to parameterize routing
      routes = router(mode: config.mode)
      {:ok, routes}

    {:error, :not_mounted} = error ->
      error
  end
end
```

Returns routes configured based on the agent's CoT configuration, allowing for mode-specific routing in the future.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Router Usage

```elixir
# Get default routes
routes = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.router()

# Routes is a list of maps:
# [
#   %{
#     path: "agent.reasoning.generate",
#     instruction: %{
#       action: Jido.Actions.CoT.GenerateReasoning,
#       description: "Generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning for a problem"
#     }
#   },
#   ...
# ]
```

### Custom Routes

```elixir
# Define custom routes
custom_routes = [
  %{
    path: "agent.reasoning.experimental",
    instruction: %{
      action: MyExperimentalAction,
      description: "Experimental reasoning pattern"
    }
  },
  %{
    path: "agent.reasoning.domain_specific",
    instruction: %{
      action: DomainSpecificAction
    }
  }
]

# Get routes with custom additions
routes = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.router(custom_routes: custom_routes)

# Now routes includes both base and custom routes
```

### Agent-Specific Routing

```elixir
# Mount skill on agent
{:ok, agent} = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.mount(agent, mode: :structured)

# Get routes configured for this agent
{:ok, routes} = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.get_routes(agent)

# Routes are parameterized based on agent's CoT configuration
```

### Registering Custom Routes on Agent

```elixir
# Mount skill
{:ok, agent} = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.mount(agent, [])

# Register custom routes
custom = [
  %{
    path: "agent.reasoning.custom",
    instruction: %{action: CustomAction}
  }
]

{:ok, routes} = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.register_custom_routes(agent, custom)

# Returns error if skill not mounted
{:error, :not_mounted} = ChainOfThought.register_custom_routes(unmounted_agent, custom)
```

### Mode-Based Routing (Future)

```elixir
# Filter routes by mode (structure in place for future enhancement)
routes_zero = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.router(mode: :zero_shot)
routes_structured = Jido.Skills.ChainOfThought.router(mode: :structured)

# Currently returns all routes, but infrastructure exists for filtering
```

## Integration with Signal System

The router integrates with Jido's signal/event system:

### Signal Pattern Matching

The skill declares signal patterns it can handle:

```elixir
use Jido.Skill,
  signal_patterns: [
    "agent.reasoning.*",
    "agent.cot.*"
  ]
```

### Route Resolution

When an agent receives a signal:

1. Signal pattern is matched against registered skills
2. Skill's `router/1` function is called to get routes
3. Route path is matched against signal type
4. Corresponding action is executed

### Example Signal Flow

```elixir
# Agent receives signal
signal = %Signal{
  type: "agent.reasoning.generate",
  data: %{problem: "What is 2 + 2?"}
}

# Router resolves to action
routes = ChainOfThought.router()
route = Enum.find(routes, fn r -> r.path == signal.type end)
action = route.instruction.action
# => Jido.Actions.CoT.GenerateReasoning

# Action is executed
{:ok, result} = action.run(signal.data, %{})
```

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Routing**: 8 routes covering all CoT actions
2. **Dual Namespaces**: Both `agent.reasoning.*` and `agent.cot.*` patterns
3. **Custom Extensibility**: Easy addition of custom routes
4. **Parameterized Routes**: Configuration-based route filtering (infrastructure)
5. **Agent-Aware**: Routes can be retrieved per-agent with configuration
6. **Well-Documented**: Full documentation for all routing functions
7. **Fully Tested**: 16 tests covering all routing scenarios
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unmounted skill

## Route Descriptions

All routes include descriptions for better documentation and introspection:

| Route | Action | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `agent.reasoning.generate` | GenerateReasoning | Generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning for a problem |
| `agent.reasoning.step` | ReasoningStep | Execute an action with thought logging |
| `agent.reasoning.validate` | ValidateReasoning | Validate execution results against reasoning expectations |
| `agent.reasoning.correct` | SelfCorrect | Analyze errors and propose corrections |
| `agent.cot.*` | (aliases) | Aliases for agent.reasoning.* routes |

## Known Limitations

1. **Mode Filtering Not Implemented**: `filter_routes_by_mode/2` returns all routes
2. **No Dynamic Route Registration**: Custom routes must be specified at router call time
3. **No Route Priorities**: All routes have equal priority
4. **No Pattern Wildcards**: Exact path matching only (no regex or glob patterns)
5. **No Route Metadata**: Limited metadata beyond description

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mode-Based Filtering**: Implement actual filtering in `filter_routes_by_mode/2`
2. **Dynamic Route Registration**: Allow runtime route registration on agents
3. **Route Priorities**: Add priority/weight to routes for conflict resolution
4. **Pattern Matching**: Support wildcards and regex in route paths
5. **Route Metadata**: Add tags, categories, versions to routes
6. **Route Validation**: Validate route structures before registration
7. **Route Introspection**: Tools to inspect and debug route resolution
