# Phase 4: Chain-of-Thought Integration for JidoAI

## Overview
This phase integrates advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities into JidoAI's autonomous agent framework, transforming it from a capable action execution system into a sophisticated reasoning platform. By leveraging JidoAI's directive-based architecture with lifecycle hooks and pluggable runners, we implement transparent CoT reasoning that enhances agent capabilities without modifying existing actions.

The integration follows a progressive approach: starting with basic zero-shot CoT reasoning, advancing to iterative refinement with self-correction, implementing sophisticated patterns like self-consistency and ReAct, and culminating in production-ready optimization with intelligent routing and caching. This phase enables JidoAI agents to handle complex multi-step reasoning tasks, code generation with validation, and multi-source research with 15-40% accuracy improvements while maintaining the framework's core strengths of modularity, fault tolerance, and scalability.

By the end of this phase, JidoAI will offer state-of-the-art performance on code generation and multi-step reasoning tasks, with custom runners for transparent CoT integration, reusable skills for easy capability mounting, and production-grade optimization for cost-effective operation at scale.

## Stage 1: Foundation (Basic CoT Runner)

This stage establishes the foundational Chain-of-Thought infrastructure by implementing the custom CoT runner, lifecycle hook integration, and reusable skill modules. We focus on zero-shot CoT patterns that add 8-15% accuracy improvement with minimal overhead (3-4x token cost, 2-3s latency). The custom runner approach provides the cleanest integration, adding transparent CoT reasoning to any agent without modifying existing actions.

The foundation enables immediate value through simple "Let's think step by step" reasoning while laying the groundwork for advanced patterns in subsequent stages. All implementations maintain backward compatibility, ensuring existing agents continue to function unchanged while new CoT-enabled agents gain enhanced reasoning capabilities.

The iterative approach is particularly effective for code generation, where test execution provides concrete feedback for self-correction. While token cost increases to 10-30x, the accuracy gains justify the expense for critical applications.
