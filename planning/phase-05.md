# Phase 5: GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) Prompt Optimization for JidoAI

## Overview
This phase integrates GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) prompt optimization into JidoAI's Chain-of-Thought framework, enabling autonomous improvement of reasoning prompts through evolutionary algorithms guided by language feedback. GEPA represents a paradigm shift from manual prompt engineering to automated, sample-efficient optimization that achieves superior results with dramatically fewer iterations than traditional reinforcement learning approaches.

GEPA treats prompt optimization as an evolutionary search problem where the LLM itself serves as a reflective coach. The system executes agents with candidate prompts, collects full execution trajectories (chain-of-thought, tool calls, outputs), and uses the LLM to analyze failures and suggest targeted improvements. Through iterative cycles of sampling, reflection, mutation, and selection, GEPA evolves a diverse population of high-performing prompts maintained along a Pareto frontier—balancing multiple objectives rather than optimizing for a single metric.

Research demonstrates GEPA's exceptional sample efficiency: achieving 10-19% performance improvements over strong baselines while using up to 35× fewer rollouts than reinforcement learning methods. On benchmark tasks, GEPA more than doubles the prompt quality improvements of prior state-of-the-art optimizers (MIPROv2). By implementing GEPA natively in Elixir using OTP concurrency, we leverage JidoAI's distributed agent architecture for parallel prompt evaluation, dramatically accelerating the optimization process.

By the end of this phase, JidoAI agents will be capable of autonomous self-improvement, continuously refining their reasoning prompts based on real-world task performance without requiring extensive manual tuning or thousands of training examples.

## Stage 1: Foundation (Basic GEPA Infrastructure)

This stage establishes the foundational GEPA infrastructure implementing the core evolutionary loop: population management, parallel evaluation, LLM-guided reflection, and mutation operators. We build the GEPA Optimizer Agent as a GenServer orchestrating prompt evolution, implement concurrent evaluation using Jido's agent spawning capabilities, and create reflection mechanisms where the LLM analyzes execution trajectories to generate targeted improvement suggestions.

The foundation enables immediate value through basic prompt optimization while laying the groundwork for advanced multi-objective selection and adaptive mechanisms in subsequent stages. All implementations leverage Elixir's OTP primitives for fault tolerance and Jido's native concurrency for parallel prompt evaluation, achieving significant speedups over sequential optimization approaches.

## Stage 2: Evolution & Selection

This stage implements sophisticated selection mechanisms and Pareto frontier management enabling multi-objective optimization. We advance from simple fitness-based selection to Pareto-optimal selection balancing multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, cost, robustness). The Pareto frontier maintains a diverse set of non-dominated solutions rather than converging to a single "best" prompt, providing options suited to different deployment constraints.

The stage introduces tournament selection, crowding distance calculations, and convergence detection mechanisms ensuring efficient exploration of the objective space. These capabilities enable GEPA to discover prompts optimized for varied scenarios: high-accuracy prompts for critical tasks, fast prompts for real-time applications, and cost-efficient prompts for large-scale deployment.
