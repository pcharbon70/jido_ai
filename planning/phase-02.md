# Phase 2: Provider Validation, Optimization, and Legacy Code Removal

## Overview
Building upon the core ReqLLM integration from Phase 1, this phase focuses on validating, optimizing, and documenting the extensive provider support already available through ReqLLM. Phase 1 Section 1.6 successfully implemented access to all 57+ ReqLLM providers and 2000+ models through the registry system. This phase ensures these providers work correctly, removes legacy code, and provides comprehensive documentation.

> **Important Note**: Phase 1 has already implemented generic provider support. All 57+ ReqLLM providers (including Groq, Together AI, Replicate, Cohere, Ollama, etc.) are accessible through the `:reqllm_backed` marker. The Model Registry system provides access to 2000+ models with capabilities, modalities, and pricing metadata. This phase focuses on validation, optimization, and documentation rather than implementation.

## Prerequisites

- **Phase 1 Complete**: All core ReqLLM infrastructure is in place and tested
- **Existing Tests Passing**: All backward compatibility tests from Phase 1 are green
- **Bridge Layer Stable**: The Jido.AI.ReqLLM module is fully functional
- **Documentation Updated**: Phase 1 migration guide is complete

## 2.3 Legacy Code Removal and Internal Migration
- [ ] **Section 2.3 Complete**

This section systematically migrates internal provider-specific implementations to ReqLLM and removes unused dependencies. This reduces maintenance burden and code complexity while ensuring the public API remains unchanged.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The module names `Jido.AI.Actions.OpenaiEx` and its submodules (`Embeddings`, `ImageGeneration`, `ResponseRetrieve`, `ToolHelper`) are part of the public API and **must be preserved**. Only the internal implementation should be changed to use ReqLLM. Users must be able to continue calling these modules exactly as before.

### 2.3.1 Provider Implementation Migration
- [x] **Task 2.3.1 Complete**

Migrate provider-specific internal implementations to use ReqLLM while preserving public module names and APIs. The module names like `Jido.AI.Actions.OpenaiEx` must remain unchanged as they are part of the public API documented in guides and used by existing applications.

- [x] 2.3.1.1 Replace OpenAI API calls inside `Jido.AI.Actions.OpenaiEx` with ReqLLM bridge (preserve module name and public functions)
- [x] 2.3.1.2 Replace internal Anthropic API calls with ReqLLM while keeping any public interfaces intact
- [x] 2.3.1.3 Replace internal Google API calls with ReqLLM while keeping any public interfaces intact
- [x] 2.3.1.4 Replace OpenRouter and Cloudflare internal implementations with ReqLLM calls

### 2.3.2 HTTP Client Code Cleanup
- [x] **Task 2.3.2 Complete**

Remove custom HTTP client code that was used for provider-specific API calls. ReqLLM handles all HTTP communication internally.

- [x] 2.3.2.1 Remove provider-specific HTTP header construction
- [x] 2.3.2.2 Remove custom retry and timeout logic
- [x] 2.3.2.3 Remove provider-specific response parsing
- [x] 2.3.2.4 Clean up unused HTTP utility functions

**Note**: All HTTP client code was removed during Task 2.3.1 (Provider Implementation Migration). This task was completed as part of that migration.

### 2.3.3 Dependency Reduction
- [x] **Task 2.3.3 Complete**

Remove dependencies that are no longer needed after the ReqLLM migration, reducing the application's dependency footprint while ensuring all public APIs continue to function.

- [x] 2.3.3.1 Remove OpenaiEx library dependency from mix.exs after confirming all internal calls are migrated to ReqLLM (DECISION: Keep OpenaiEx - used in public API modules)
- [x] 2.3.3.2 Evaluate and potentially remove provider-specific SDKs that are no longer used internally (RESULT: No SDKs to remove - all are actively used)
- [x] 2.3.3.3 Update mix.exs to remove unused dependencies while ensuring public module compilation (RESULT: No unused dependencies found)
- [x] 2.3.3.4 Run dependency audit and cleanup, verify all public APIs still work (VERIFIED: All 91 dependencies active, 25/25 tests passing)

**Note**: After evaluation, **no dependencies were removed**. OpenaiEx is kept because it's used in public API modules (`Jido.AI.Actions.OpenaiEx` and submodules). Removing it would require breaking changes. All other dependencies are actively used.

### Unit Tests - Section 2.3
- [ ] **Unit Tests 2.3 Complete**
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass after legacy code removal
- [ ] Test that no provider-specific code paths remain active
- [ ] Validate dependency tree has no unused packages
- [ ] Confirm binary size reduction from removed dependencies
