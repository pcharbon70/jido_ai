defmodule Jido.Runner.SelfConsistency.VotingMechanism do
  @moduledoc """
  Voting and consensus mechanisms for self-consistency CoT.

  Implements multiple voting strategies to select the most reliable answer
  from multiple reasoning paths:

  ## Voting Strategies

  - **Majority Voting**: Select answer with highest frequency
  - **Confidence-Weighted**: Weight votes by path confidence scores
  - **Quality-Weighted**: Weight votes by path quality scores
  - **Hybrid**: Combine multiple weighting factors

  ## Tie-Breaking

  When multiple answers have equal votes, tie-breaking strategies:
  - Highest average confidence
  - Highest average quality
  - First occurrence
  - Random selection

  ## Research

  Self-consistency with majority voting shows +17.9% accuracy improvement
  on GSM8K benchmark. Confidence weighting can further improve reliability
  on tasks with varying reasoning quality.
