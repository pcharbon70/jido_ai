  Prompt templates for Chain-of-Thought reasoning generation.

  This module provides prompt templates for different CoT reasoning modes:
  - Zero-shot: Simple "Let's think step by step" prompting
  - Few-shot: Reasoning with examples (future)
  - Structured: Task-specific structured reasoning (future)

  alias Jido.AI.Prompt

  @doc """
  Generates a zero-shot reasoning prompt for the given instructions and agent state.

  The zero-shot prompt uses the "Let's think step by step" pattern which has been
  shown to improve reasoning accuracy by 8-15% on complex tasks.

  ## Parameters

  - `instructions` - List of pending instructions to reason about
  - `agent_state` - Current agent state map
  - `opts` - Optional keyword list of options

  ## Returns

  A `%Jido.AI.Prompt{}` struct containing the reasoning prompt.

  ## Example

      iex> instructions = [%{action: MyAction, params: %{value: 42}}]
      iex> state = %{context: "some context"}
      iex> prompt = ReasoningPrompt.zero_shot(instructions, state)
      iex> [message] = prompt.messages
      iex> message.content =~ "Let's think step by step"
